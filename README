NAME
    String::Index - Perl XS module for strchr()/index() hybrids

SYNOPSIS
      use String::Index qw( cindex ncindex crindex ncrindex );
  
      $first_vowel    =   cindex("broadcast", "aeiouy");  # 2
      $last_vowel     =  rcindex("broadcast", "aeiouy");  # 6
      $first_nonvowel =  ncindex("eerily",    "aeiouy");  # 2
      $last_nonvowel  = ncrindex("eerily",    "aeiouy");  # 4

ABSTRACT
    This module provides functions that are a cross between Perl's "index()"
    and "rindex()" and C's "strchr()" and "strrchr()".

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides four functions that are Perl/C hybrids. They allow
    you to scan a string for the first or last occurrence of any of a set of
    characters, or not of a set of characters.

  Exported on request
    There are four functions, which must be exported explicitly.

    cindex(STR, CHARS, POSITION)
    cindex(STR, CHARS)
        It returns the position of the first occurrence of one of CHARS in
        STR at or after POSITION. If POSITION is omitted, starts searching
        from the beginning of the string. The return value is based at 0. If
        none of the characters you are searching for are found, it returns
        -1.

    ncindex(STR, CHARS, POSITION)
    ncindex(STR, CHARS)
        It returns the position of the first occurrence of a character other
        than those in the string CHARS in STR at or after POSITION. If
        POSITION is omitted, starts searching from the beginning of the
        string. The return value is based at 0. If STR is composed entirely
        of characters in CHARS, it returns -1.

    crindex(STR, CHARS, POSITION)
    crindex(STR, CHARS)
        Works just like "cindex()" except that it returns the position of
        the LAST occurrence of any of CHARS in STR. If POSITION is
        specified, returns the last occurrence at or before that position.

    ncrindex(STR, CHARS, POSITION)
    ncrindex(STR, CHARS)
        Works just like "ncindex()" except that it returns the position of
        the LAST occurrence of any character other than those in CHARS in
        STR. If POSITION is specified, returns the last occurrence at or
        before that position.
